<P>This is a relatively basic Index Server application 
using the Query object from the referenced&nbsp;<STRONG>'ixsso Control 
Library'</STRONG>            
    &nbsp;(ixsso.dll).</P>
<P>              
         
                
             
        I used MSDN library files to help 
me build up this VB6 version (see the&nbsp;below link).&nbsp;I couldn't see any VB6 versions around, 
so I&nbsp;just used the ASP VB Script code to build this. A lot 
can be done with Index Server and this is really just scraping the surface.</P>
<P>My initial reason for looking at Index Server was so I could search for CV's 
in a particular directory that I would set up. If you create your own Catalog 
and add certain Directory's to that Catalog, you can then specify which Catalog 
to search in. Handy if you have documents that need to be kept in separate 
folders etc. </P>
<P>In order to access Index Server and have a look at its functionality on your 
computer;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
  <P>1. Go to 'Control Panel'.<BR>2. Open 'Administrative Tools'<BR>3. Open 
  'Computer Management'<BR>4. Expand 'Services and Applications'<BR>5. Expand 
  'Indexing Service'<BR>6. Expand the two Catalogs that are there (should be 
  'System' and 'Web')</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P dir=ltr>Then just start 'tooling around' in these two. Fire some test words 
at each and see what you can come up with!<BR><BR><FONT color=red><STRONG>**Be 
careful in here though, as this area is used by your computer when you do normal 
searches!</STRONG></FONT></P>
<P>OK, So this is to get the ball rolling and I would like to 
see if other developers can pick up on this and expand upon it.<FONT
